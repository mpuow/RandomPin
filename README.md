## WORK IN PROGRESS

The idea is to create a small but secure journal application, that has a random pin pattern every time the app is opened. The hashed pin is set and stored locally, along with the database containing the encrypted contents of the journal.
The app is functionally done, just needs the journal encryption, appropriate styling and a few tweaks. The app is currently set to open straight to the journal for ease of development.

# To-Do
- Journal value encryption
- Style application
