# *WORK IN PROGRESS*

<p>The idea is to create a small but secure journal application, that has a random pin pattern generated every time the app is opened. The hashed pin is set and stored locally, along with the database containing the encrypted contents of the journal.</p>

<p>Most of the app is functionally complete, it just needs appropriate styling, journal encryption and a few tweaks.</p>

<p>The app is currently set to open straight to the journal for ease of development.</p>

## To-Do
- Journal value encryption
- Style application
